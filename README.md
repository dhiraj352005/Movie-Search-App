task : Movie Search app


Description :
🎬 Movie Search App – React.js Project
This is a simple yet functional Movie Search App built using React.js that allows users to search for their favorite movies using the OMDb API (Open Movie Database). The app fetches real-time movie data based on user queries and displays information such as the title, release year, poster, and type (movie, series, etc.).

The main goal of this project was to practice React.js fundamentals such as component structure, props and state management, conditional rendering, useEffect, and handling asynchronous API requests. It is part of my journey as a React developer and showcases my understanding of integrating external APIs, building responsive UIs, and creating clean and maintainable code.

🚀 Features
🔍 Live Search Functionality – Users can type in any movie name and get search results instantly.

🎞️ Displays Movie Posters – Pulls poster images from the API and displays them in a neat grid.

🧠 Handles Loading States – Shows a loading indicator while fetching data.

🚫 Handles No Results / Errors – Displays a friendly message when no movie is found or an error occurs.

⚛️ Component-Based Structure – Built entirely using functional components and React Hooks (useState, useEffect).

💻 Responsive Design – Looks good on both desktop and mobile screens (basic responsive layout).

🛠️ Technologies Used
React.js (Functional Components + Hooks)

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5 / CSS3

OMDb API – for fetching movie data

Axios or Fetch API – for handling API requests

🧾 Future Improvements
Add pagination or infinite scrolling.

Implement search suggestions as the user types.

Add filter options (by year, type, etc.)

Display more details on movie click (using routing or a modal).

Improve UI with animations or a modern design library (like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI).

🙌 Acknowledgements
Thanks to the OMDb API for providing a free and easy-to-use movie database.

Inspired by beginner-friendly React projects to solidify my concepts.

📌 Final Thoughts
This project helped me understand how to build interactive applications using React and external APIs. It also helped me practice writing clean code, managing state effectively, and working on real-world use cases like loading data, error handling, and user input. Feel free to clone this repo, explore the code, or suggest improvements.
